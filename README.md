# Event_Management_System_Cplusplus
This Introducing Event Management System V1 - an open source Windows console app developed in C++! It serves as an Event Management System, originally created as a university assignment. Contribution will be appreciated. 

***Instructions for Event MS V1:

1. The Source Code has no dependencies for additional files, it should compile
without any problems given that compiler is "g++", cppStandard = "c++17", cStandard = "c17".

2. This is around 970 lines of code, any contribution to optimizie it will be greatly appreciated.

3. The Program requires a file named "event.txt" in its parent directory, if it does not 
exists it will create one.

4. Please follow the instructions the program gives for unexpected results.

5. Many input validations and error handling are in place, Still please look for things like 
entering single digit month with 0 at start e.g., "03".

6. Avoid deleting the first event, nothing happens other than the overall look of program in 
view module doesnt look good, but functionality isnt affected.


***Features of Event MS V1:

1. Allows you to add events easliy.

2. Prevents you from adding any event in past with reference to current time.

3. Events can be added based on existing events.

4. In View module, you can view any event you want and also the remaining time.

5. Checks for the main file and if it isnt working it will fix the problem.

6. Offers easy navigation and enough instructions.
